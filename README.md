### What is TDD ?
 - Test-driven development reverses traditional development and testing. So, instead of writing your code first and then retroactively fitting a test to validate the piece of code you just wrote, test-driven development dictates that you write the test first and then implement code changes until your code passes the test you already wrote.

### - What is the Benefit ?
 - Fewer bugs and errors are the primary benefit of the TDD approach.
 - When the code has fewer bugs, you'll spend less time fixing them than other programming methodologies. TDD produces a higher overall test coverage and, therefore to a better quality of the final product

### Steps:
- Create a file Test_td.py to write the test cases
- Run those test cases, initially they'll fail as we don't have any code
- Create a new file Calc.py and Write down the code for basic calculations
- Now, go back to Test_td.py and run the test cases again

- To run test enter following command in terminal
- python -m pytest -v

- Now all the test cases have passed
