### Python TDD
### What is TDD ?
### - Test-driven development reverses traditional development and testing. So, instead of writing your code first and then retroactively fitting a test to validate the piece of code you just wrote, test-driven development dictates that you write the test first and then implement code changes until your code passes the test you already wrote.

### - What is the Benefit ?
### - Fewer bugs and errors are the primary benefit of the TDD approach.
### - When the code has fewer bugs, you'll spend less time fixing them than other programming methodologies. TDD produces a higher overall test coverage and, therefore to a better quality of the final product
